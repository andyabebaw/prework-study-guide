        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> <!DOCTYPE> is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li> Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the <body> element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li> Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li> External style sheets allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === "object"). The language usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value</li>
          <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false.</li>
          <li>You can check if a number is within the range of safe integers using Number.isSafeInteger()</li>
          <li>NaN ("Not a Number") is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
          <li>A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the BigInt() function.</li>
          <li>The String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units. Each element in the string occupies a position in the string. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a string is the number of UTF-16 code units in it, which may not correspond to the actual number of Unicode characters; see the String reference page for more details.</li>
          <li>JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.</li>
          <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property (see below). In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms". The purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code.</li>
          <li>In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier. In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being callable.</li>
          <li>connect script.js to index.html by adding a script element under the footer</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
