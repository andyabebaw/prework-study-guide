        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> <!DOCTYPE> is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li> Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the <body> element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li> Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li> External style sheets allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
